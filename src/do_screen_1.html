              Nuts and bolts should regularly be examined to ensure that they are not loose. It’s important to check
              that the nuts that attach your wheels to the axle are securely fastened. These nuts should be tightened to
              the point where they can no longer turn.

              Turn your board upside down, and adjust the nut in the middle of each truck counter clockwise with a half
              of a quarter turn to tighten it. The tighter your kingpin bolt, the more security you will have when
              skating.

              Whether you’re a professional skater or a novice to the sport, protective gear is essential if you want to
              skate safely. Wearing a helmet might not earn you cool points, but it will keep you safe and even protect
              you from getting a concussion if you fall and land on your head. It’s best to protect all areas that are
              exposed, including your head, knees, and wrists.

                  Jump off your board by placing your back foot onto the ground in front of the skateboard, and
                  following with your front foot. Begin running in the direction that you were traveling in and only
                  stop the board once you have slowed down and regained control.

                Rolling distributes the impact of a fall and prevents serious injury. Remember to shield your face with
                your arms and aim to land on your back or shoulders.

                outside of your comfort zone, you should not try it until you are ready.
